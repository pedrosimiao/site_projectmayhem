                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p>Located within a large, crumbling Victorian mansion, 
                the Paper Street Soap Company takes pride in crafting exquisite high-end soaps that stand out in the market. 
                Our company is fueled by the dedicated efforts of 72 collaborators, affectionately known as "space monkeys." 
                These individuals undergo meticulous training guided by a set of fundamental principles, the first of which is shrouded 
                in secrecy and humorously referred to as "the first rule" - an unwritten rule that forbids any mention of its existence.
                </p>
                <p>At Paper Street Soap Company, we endeavor to provide more than just a cleansing experience. Our soaps embody a sense of rebellion 
                against the mundane, encouraging individuals to break free from societal constraints and embrace their true essence.
                </p>
                <p>Each purchase supports our mission of defying conformity and unleashing a powerful revolution of personal liberation, 
                striking at the very heart of financial institutions.</p>
                <p>Join us on this clandestine journey and always remember...the first rule of Paper Street Soap Company is: 
                YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT!
                </p>
